# Vim setup
Automatic, probably naive vim install and setup.

Installs macvim and Vundle if they are not already present and installs plugins. 

# Installation
This currently assumes you have Homebrew installed (and therefore is OS X-specific obviously).

1.  `git clone https://github.com/timcosgrove/.vim.git ~/.vim`
1. `~/.vim/vim_setup.sh`

You'll probably need to source your shell config when this is done.
